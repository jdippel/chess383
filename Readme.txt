1. Introduction
---------------

src/main/java/chess383/ICoordinate.java is an Java interface and part
of an implementation of basic movements according to the laws of chess.
This Java implementation provides an iterator functionality to get
the possible target squares.
Because this is only a layer the usage is shown within the JUnit tests.


2. Files
--------

This layer consist of the following files:

  * Readme.txt, the file you are currently reading.

  * Copying.txt, a text file containing the GNU General Public
    License.

  * coordinate.xml, a very simple ant build file
  
  * src, a subdirectory containing the full source code
  


3. Building
------------------------

There is an Ant build file that starts the JUnit tests.
If JUnit and Ant are installed, simply call "ant -f coordinate.xml" 
to start the JUnit tests.

Maybe the path to the junit.jar has to be aligned.


4. Terms of use
---------------

The layer is free, 
and distributed under the GNU General Public License (GGPLv3).

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute this layer in
some way, you must always include the full source code, or a pointer
to where the source code can be found.  If you make any changes to the
source code, these changes must also be made available under the GGPLv3.

For full details, read the copy of the GPL found in the file named
Copying.txt.
